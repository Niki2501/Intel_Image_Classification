# Intel_Image_Classification
Data Collections
There are around 58 classes and each class has around 120 images. the labels.csv file has the respective description of the traffic sign class. You can change the assignment of these classIDs with descriptions. We can use the basic CNN model to get decent val accuracy. We have around 2000 files for testing.

# *Deployment using Streamlit Steps*
Create folder
Add saved model to the created folder
Copy the folder link
Open it using command prompt using cd command
Write next command (code .) it will open vs code with specified folder
Create a virtual environment using terminal or command prompt
Steps for creating virtual environment
Using conda : conda create -n envname python=x.x(python version
Activate using :conda activate venv(virtual environment name)
Using python for command prompt : python venv venv-name
Activate using : environment name\Scripts\activate
Now install all the required library inside venv
Run the streamlit using streamlit run appname.py
